# Exquisite-Corpse-Baki-Guher

When *The Little Red Riding Hood* could not catch the train after the school, *Gandalf The Grey* summoned her a **ferrari**. 

"Ooh, I love this" said RRH, as she left the old man in the dust, driving off into the sunset.  

*Gandalf The Grey* said: It's a beautiful sunset! I will go and take a nap on a bench in the park.  
It was a midnight when he woke up hearing the sound of a car braking, then a bang...And finally the scream of a beast.  
*The Little Red Riding Hood* hit the *Wolf* who ate her grandma! Finally.
