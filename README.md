# Exquisite-Corpse-Baki-Guher

When *The Little Red Riding Hood* could not catch the train after the school, *Gandalf The Grey* summoned her a **ferrari**. 

"Ooh, I love this" said RRH, as she left the old man in the dust, driving off into the sunset.  

*Gandalf The Grey* said: It's a beautiful sunset! I will go and take a nap on a bench in the park.  
It was a midnight when he woke up hearing the sound of a car braking, then a bang...And finally the scream of a beast.  
*The Little Red Riding Hood* hit the *Wolf* who ate her grandma! Finally. 

*Gandalf The Grey* was about to continue napping, content that *The Little Red Riding Hood* had settled her grudge with the *Wolf*.
<br>
It was then he sat up with a shock, remembering the car was insured in his name. 
<br>
He rushed over to the spot of the accident and true enough, he saw a busted up Ferrari, a dead wolf and *The Little Red Riding Hood* was nowhere to be seen. 
<br>

Even more strange was the fact that the wolf's head was seperated form his body.
The head showed bitmarke and a considerable part of his skin was gnawed off.
*Gandalf The Grey* stumbled back in horror. Was *Red Riding Hood* possessed by an elder being?!
